Bugs to fix before push:
* Card page autofloating doesn't wait for card images to load
 - Make that function set the wider of the image and mockup tabs, and Set an extra onload trigger for the image load to do the same.
 - Or better, in fact, edit the tab onswitch function to adjust the width then. Plus set an onload trigger on the image.

To make whole-VS page:

* Look up syntax to Rails.cache.read
* Make vs page cache the frame letters for this cardset
* No need to cache the frame buttons or will_paginate
* Cache what's inside that instead

* Read my JS for hovers to find Ajax syntax
* Algorithm for whole-VS page:

- Precalc what pages we're expecting (Split frame letters into pages) & generate JS that knows that
- Generate JS with an onload to request first fragment. This request has an onSuccess to append this section, increment some counter & request the next fragment.
* Put a loading spinny at the bottom. Final onSuccess hides the spinny.
