To fix:
* Find big {C} symbol and put it in images/mana/large - similarly {PR} etc

Bugs to fix before push:
* Tabbing past "watermark none" sends a request for /cards/1234/undefined. 

To test before push:


Bugs:
* Forced token with forced colour (possibly also with DFC?) can get its database frame set to "token Red token", and thus lose its frame setting to "Auto", because frame_display comes back as "token Red"
------

To make whole-VS page:

* Look up syntax to Rails.cache.read
* Make vs page cache the frame letters for this cardset
* No need to cache the frame buttons or will_paginate
* Cache what's inside that instead

* Read my JS for hovers to find Ajax syntax
* Algorithm for whole-VS page:

- Precalc what pages we're expecting (Split frame letters into pages) & generate JS that knows that
- Generate JS with an onload to request first fragment. This request has an onSuccess to append this section, increment some counter & request the next fragment.
* Put a loading spinny at the bottom. Final onSuccess hides the spinny.
