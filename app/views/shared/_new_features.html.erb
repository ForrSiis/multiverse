### #{update_title}
#### Thu Mar 10 01:13:25 2011

Two updates this week. The preview tooltips introduced last week are now no longer restricted to triple-bracket links in comments or details pages, but apply to any and all links to a card on Multiverse. This means that details pages like [the story of Liberia](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cardsets/78/comments#comment_4056) are now much more readable. You'll also get preview tooltips on a cardset's Recent Activity page for all the card links, and on links to a card in a different cardset such as [this one](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cards/5533#comment_4766).

I also implemented a couple of enhancements to the card editing page. You can now review the comments and history of a card from within the edit page - just click the "History" tab. And if your cardset has a skeleton, then an excerpt from the skeleton will be shown on the card edit page if the card code matches one in the skeleton.

----

### New Feature: Tooltip Card Images and Mockups
#### Wed Mar 2 01:41:50 2011
A nifty new enhancement went live today. Whenever you're looking at a comment or details page that includes links created with [[[triple brackets]]] or (((triple parens))), if you move your mouse cursor over the link, the target will pop up in a preview window. This works with links to printed Wizards cards in [[[triple square brackets]]], and links to other cards in the cardset in triple parens - in any of the three forms (((Card name))), (((CW01))) (card code), or (((-CW01))) (expand card code to show card name as well).

This means that discussions like [this one](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cards/2042) will be rather easier to follow. It means that [set skeletons](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cardsets/14/details_pages/29) will preview each card that exists (i.e. its code is not parenthesised) as you mouseover those codes. And it also means when you're posting a comment, if you name an existing card or a card in the same cardset, it's a really good idea to use the triple-bracket or triple-paren links, because it makes it much easier for people to follow what you're saying!

----

### New Feature: Front Page
#### Wed Feb 23 21:36:41 2011
A new feature today, for those of you who've been wanting to customise your cardset's first impressions. You can now create a details page called "Front Page", which won't display in the normal list of details pages; instead, it'll display at the top of your cardset's main page, just after the cardset description and before any highlighted comments. You can use this to show off some of your most interesting cards, by typing ((Cardname)) into the text of the details page. See [Clockwork Wings](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cardsets/32) for an example. 

A few other minor tweaks have gone in too. Cardsets can have gold borders; recent changes lists display the time when they were generated (in your browser's time zone); skeletons have got a bit nicer; and there's a new type of link supported, which lets you link to a card in a way that'll display whatever the card's name is. You can add these links by using three parentheses and a dash, followed by the card's code: (((-CW01))). 

----

### New Feature: Search
#### Tue Feb 15 02:29:10 2011
Just one update for this week, but it's a big one: Multiverse is now searchable! The top of each page has a "Search" box. Type into that the (whole or partial) name of a card or cardset, then press Enter, and you'll be taken straight to it! If you matched the name of several cards, it'll ask you which one you want.

You can also click the "Search" link at the top of each page to go to an Advanced Search page, for more precise searching on the contents of cards, cardsets, details pages, and even comments. Can't remember quite which card it was where you made a comment with a devastatingly witty reference to the Spanish Inquisition? Search for comments whose body includes "nobody expects" and you'll be there!

----

### New Feature: Card Edit Comments
#### Thu Feb 10 01:33:59
A quick mid-week update, to fix a couple of bugs and add a new feature, simple yet helpful: card edit comments. Whenever you edit a card, you have the opportunity to add a brief description of what you did; for example, "Reduced P/T and mana cost", or "Fixed ability as suggested by Bob". If you include such a comment, it'll be displayed in the card history.

The card edit page also now tells people how to insert Planeswalker loyalty symbols: it's `\[+1]`, `\[0]`, or `\[-X]`.

----

### New Feature: Card Contents Shrink-To-Fit, Edits Show in Card History
#### Tue Feb 8 01:01:37
The update this week is simple: your card text will now fit on your card. 

No longer will your excessively-long cardnames push the mana cost out of the title bar, or the too-long type line disappear behind the rarity, or your overly-wordy text box stretch the card too much vertically. Now all these elements will be smoothly resized in your browser by a little Javascript. Even the ridiculously over-worded [Sienira's Facets](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cardsets/1) cards all fit, even if some of their [text boxes](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cards/222) or [type lines](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cards/1732) are still too dense for Wizards to actually print.

It won't carry it to excess. If you write an essay for each of your Planeswalker's abilities, it'll still stretch the card rather than reduce the font to smaller than 6 point text. But this should result in some rather nicer-looking cards, particularly in boosters and visual spoilers.

There are a few other tweaks that have gone in. Cards will now print properly from visual spoilers and suchlike. And a card's comment log now also includes where someone edited the card, so that you can see where the conversation was punctuated by an edit.

----
### New Features: Planeswalkers, Border Colour, Fuller Cardlist
#### Fri Jan 28 01:44:29
Several features that people have been asking for. First, planeswalker cards now have a much nicer mockup, with an approximation to the special planeswalker frame as used by Wizards of the Coast.

Cardsets can now have border colours other than black. The assorted silver-bordered sets of silliness can now have silver borders. Those of you making core sets may like to make your core set white-bordered, if you want. And someone might want a purple-bordered set... maybe.

The "full cardlist" page is now nicer to use. It includes the rules text of all cards. Clicking the "Colour" column will now sort cards in the order Colourless-White-Blue-Black-Red-Green-Multicolour-Hybrid-Artifact-Land. Clicking the "cost" column will now sort by converted mana cost. And you can now turn off some columns if you don't want to see them by default.

Finally, on a cardset's recent activity view, you can now mark comments as highlighted / unaddressed / normal, or go straight to the Edit Comment screen, without having to click through to the thing the comment was on. This was a feature requested by Vitenka on the [Feature Requests page](http://www.toothycat.net/wiki/wiki.pl?Multiverse/BugsAndFeatures), so I added it. If there's a feature you'd like to see, add it to the [Feature Requests page](http://www.toothycat.net/wiki/wiki.pl?Multiverse/BugsAndFeatures) and there's a good chance I'll do it!

### New Features: Set Skeletons and New Features List!
#### Sun Jan 23 09:26:00
Two new features for you this weekend! Firstly, I've added this New Features page, so that I've got a way to tell you when Multiverse supports some funky new capability. I've added the details and times for the past few updates, so take a look below: there may be something you missed.

Secondly, Multiverse now supports and generates Set Skeletons! These are a special type of details page that helps you plan the structure of your cardset. They may not be useful if you're just throwing a few cards together, but if you're designing a full cardset - especially one designed for Limited play - then a skeleton can be invaluable to help you plan and keep track of what representation you have in different colours and rarities of your mechanics, card types, or anything else. You can read more about skeletons in [Mark Rosewater's article "Design Skeletons"](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/78), and see some examples of in-progress set skeletons in [Arcunda](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cardsets/14/skeleton) and [Rallikar](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cardsets/49/skeleton).

----
### New Features: (((Card Code)))
#### Sat Jan 15 00:16:46 

You can now include (((triple parenthesis links))) to card codes like CW01 that _don't exist yet_. Clicking on these links will take you to the card creation page, with the appropriate fields already filled in. This is useful for set skeletons such as those on [Arcunda](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cardsets/14/details_pages/29). I'm expecting to provide a way to generate these skeletons for any cardset within the week.

----
### New Features: Basic and Token Rarities, Supertypes Clearer
#### Mon Jan 10 02:00:51 2011

There are now two more options for card rarities: Basic and Token. These will each appear in the appropriate slot in the virtual boosters. If a cardset has any tokens, this means the booster will now be 16 cards. (If a cardset doesn't contain any basic cards, it'll just use a random basic land as it always did. If a cardset doesn't contain any tokens, the boosters will remain 15 cards rather than 16.) The token frame is quite flashy - check out [an example](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cards/2657) :) 

I've also done some work on the card editing form, specifically the type line. The three text boxes were always meant to be supertype, type and subtype, but many people were using the leftmost one (supertype) for card types such as Creature or Artifact, and frankly I can't blame them. I've tried to make the interface a lot clearer: the type and subtype boxes are as they were, but the supertype box is now a supertype dropdown, with options for each of the current supertypes: Legendary, Basic, World and Snow. But if you want to combine multiple of those, or make up your own supertypes, there's another option in the dropdown, Custom, which will restore the free text entry supertype field. I'm hoping this will make it a lot easier for people to use Multiverse easily and correctly. I've gone through all the cards which had a card type (like Creature or Artifact) in the supertype box and fixed them up.

Finally, for those of you who use the CSV Import feature, if you encounter errors, those errors should in most cases be a bit more useful now.

----
### New Features: All Activity in Cardset Recent Activity
#### Sat Jan 8 01:06:34 2011

The new kinds of activity - deleting cards and comments, updating mechanics, and so on - now appear in the cardset recent activity list.

----
### New Features: Embed Images / Mockups with Double Brackets
#### Thu Jan 6 09:36:56 2011

I've finally introduced a feature I've always meant to add. The triple-bracket syntaxes for links to \\[\\[\\[printed cards]]] and (((cards in the same cardset))) were always designed to allow me to introduce **double**-bracket links. These will appear not as just a hyperlink, but embed the full image of the card into the comment or details page where you use them. 

This lets you do some very cool things. On details pages you can include the mockups of several cards, to allow you to show examples, like [this](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cardsets/1/details_pages/1), and of course any embedded mockups like this will always show the latest state of the card. (This will also be useful when I let you embed a details page into the front page of your set, so that certain showcase cards are always shown off.) You can do these in comments too, such as [this one](http://multiverse.heroku.com/cards/1463#comment_1467), so that in certain cases where the substance of your comment would be enhanced by showing the text of a card, you can do that. 

Those of you who visit [draw3cards.com](http://draw3cards.com) will note that the Markdown for embedding card links and card images is identical on Multiverse to how it is there, and that's of course deliberate.

----
### New Features: Recent Activity View
#### Mon Jan 3 00:36:34 2011

The "Cardsets" link at the top-centre of every Multiverse page has been replaced with a "Recent updates" link. This still shows you a list of all cardsets, but now they're sorted by how recently anything happened on the cardset. It shows you what the most recent activity was and who it was by. The time link (like "2 hours ago") goes to the list of *all* recent activity for the cardset in question, so you can see what all of the hot topics are in each cardset you're interested in. 

The cardsets view is now sortable, so you can always still sort it alphabetically, or by number of cards in the cardset, or any of the other columns if you want. And a number of new types of activity are now being logged that didn't show up in recent activity logs before. Deleting cards/comments/details pages now shows up, although there's less information available on things that have been deleted. Creating, editing and deleting mechanics also shows up now.

----
### New Features: Bold and Italics in Card Text
#### Fri Dec 31 02:28:27 2010

For a long time I didn't have a way to provide italicised words in card text that weren't in parentheses. Normally  you don't need to, but for ability words such as "*Metalcraft* - ~ has +2/+2 as long as you control 3 or more artifacts", the ability word is properly in italics. Now you can do this, just the same way you'd make any other text in Multiverse italicised: surround it by asterisks or underscores, like `*Metalcraft*`. Similarly, flavour text is normally italicised, but if you want bits of it to not be italics, or to be in bold, you can do that too.

This isn't full Markdown support for card texts: there are assorted problems with that, and I don't think it's a good idea. But if there's any other formatting you want to be able to do in card text, let me know your use case and I'll give it some consideration.

----
### New Features: Export to CSV and Plain Text
#### Thu Dec 30 23:44:39 2010

The cardset Export page now has three types of export. The "plain text" spoiler is now *really* plain text - it arrives in MIME-type text/plain. The CSV is suitable for re-importing into Multiverse's Import page. And the XML probably won't be much use to most people, but it might be to someone. It's there, anyway.
