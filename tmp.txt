confusing, so this card shouldn't be any lower than rare. Fortunately the mechanic is powerful enough to be rare anyway. It's pretty much guaranteed to kill the
 creatures fighting it, but it won't normally trample over for anything more than the creature's normal power. I don't think it's a problem, though I'd be inter
ested to hear other comments.", "Lifelink on an enchantment made me laugh, but it makes amazing sense for the set.\r\nI also enjoy the way you put the name toge

 of new improvements including explicit links for individual mechanics.\r\n\r\nI started designing the set with a random collection of woodland creature cards,

anic. Even those like (((Arcane Scriptorium))) that can add mana without losing loyalty aren't \"strictly better\" than basic lands, because (a) they can be att
acked, and (b) loyalty abilities can only be activated on your turn at sorcery speed.", "By the way, I specifically designed the mechanics support so that you c
ould use it for \"macros\" and non-keyworded mechanics like Fragile here. You do it by putting the whole string \"If a player controls deals damage to equipped
creature, they may destroy this instead.\" in the name of the macro, and no reminder text, and then you can paste it into multiple cards by just including `[Fra
gile]` instead. Of course, you don't have to use it, particularly while its presence will force a currently hardcoded \"Mechanics\" details-page to the front of
 your informative details pages.", ":) Thank you :)\r\n\r\nI was very liberal with coloured artefacts on whim as several just felt natural like that (they could
 have had coloured activations, but the dual mana cost feels like it fulfils the \"not better than colours\" mission of artefacts) and it's a mechanic which can
 add something cool to the set without a lot of mechanical baggage. (The same for scry, wither, etc, even though I suppose there normally wouldn't be so many me
chanics repeated a little bit at once.)", "The way I figured them is that you can get a slow, steady trickle of generic mana or you can wait for the land to 'ch
arge up' (as your mechanic is named) and get stronger, colour specific mana every so often. I can always remove the colourless mana option but I feel that, with
out it, they would only ever see play in limited (probably true anyway).", "yeah because Scrycling is kinda clunky. Nice idea for a new mechanic riffing on two
existing ones.", "Finally put together a creature ability mechanic. Ferocity. Still pretty unsure about it though.", "**Actively seeking suggestions for steampu

mething.\r\nBut how exactly are we defining a Contraption and the Assemble mechanic?\r\nMy thinking of contraptions was that it would basically be equipment for
 artifacts in the form of other artifacts. So, a bunch of different artifacts could become one huge machine, or contraption in this case. In short, contraption
is equipment, and assemble is equip - to an extent.", "I don't think there's any point making Contraptions if you don't make them work with [[[Steamflogger Boss
]]]. [[[Steamflogger Boss]]] is the reason and inspiration for Contraptions; what's the point in giving him errata? His wording is actually quite difficult to m
ake something sensible work with, but that's the challenge; I can't see any point making something that \"almost\" works with [[[Steamflogger Boss]]]. Other peo
ple are welcome to, but it's all-or-nothing for me with Contraptions.\r\n\r\nAs for plugging artifacts together like equipment: heh. That's another of my ideas,
 heading for the same kind of feel, but with a different mechanical approach. The equipment-for-artifacts is a fun idea - I was going to call it Bolt-On, but my
 wife suggested the much better name Connector. The question is, what do you make them do? Almost all Equipment either modify power and toughness, or interact w
ith combat in some other way. Fortifications were a great idea for one card ([[[Darksteel Garrison]]]), but they have the same problem if you try to make twenty
 of them: what do they do? I actually do have a plan for how to make Connectors relevant and present in enough quantities in the set, but I'd be curious to rece
ive your thoughts, since our ideas have rather paralleled each other so far :)\r\n\r\nAnd the different power types are like five more colours of mana, yes, exc
ept they go in your power pool. This would let me do things like make the power pool empty at different times than the mana pool, or behave differently in other
 ways, but I probably want to make it behave similarly to the mana pool to increase intuitive comprehensibility. It's basically five more mana types, to let the
 players plug lots of different artifacts together to transfer power between them and assemble random fun machines made of several artifacts to do something ran
dom.... a bit like what a contraption might be ;)", "Yeah I was having trouble wording this correctly. Your suggestion doesn't work as it doesn't stop Unearth,
Flashback & similar mechanics. Definately need to work on this one a bit more. Obviously, with the graveyard matters theme in the set, this is the hoser card.",

\n* Contraptions should fit the flavour of contraptions. (eg. combining two artefacts into one fits the flavour EXCELLENTLY. being a 1/1 creature with no abilit
ies fits it much less)\r\n* The idea of connectors is so cool for this set it probably wants to be the underlying mechanic for contraptions.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI
will also keep any steampunk mechanics that occur to me in mind and send them on to you :)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Hm. Perhaps if riggers tend to do non-repeatable it make
s Boss relevant. Although, it still leaves the question of why it says \"if a <i>rigger</i> would assemble a contraption\" rather than \"if you would assemble a
 contraption\". It sounds more like dealing damage than doing anything to cards. (I don't think a creature with \"T: exile target creature\" can be described as
 \"if a creature exiles another creature\" can it?) It seems to imply lots of creatures can assemble equipment, but riggers are especially good at it. But if al
l cards that assemble equipment say so, it seems unfair only riggers get the bonus; it feels like it should be like equipment, where any creature can use equipm
ent, but kor do it better. But what does assembling a contraption mean if anyone can do it? Should there be cards that say \"1. Artefact -- Contraption. Assembl
e -- Tap a creature: exile two artefacts, ~ gains all the abilities of both of them?\" _maybe_ that would work but I still don't like it.\r\n\r\nBut if you can
